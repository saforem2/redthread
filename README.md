# redthread

A sticky-note pegboard for your terminal. Mouse-first, keyboard-friendly,
transparent over your tmux theme. ASCII-textured cork, dangling red
strings, smooth zoom, and multiple named boards you can switch between.

## What it is

- A small TUI meant to live in a tmux pane, always open.
- A cork pegboard rendered entirely in ASCII — your terminal background
  shows through, no solid fill.
- Sticky notes you drag with the mouse or nudge with the keyboard.
  Colored paper, red pin, ornate woven borders, paper-fiber flecks,
  drop shadow, fold glyph.
- **Red strings** between notes (or pinned to bare cork). Slack or
  tight. In-front-of or behind the notes. A weighted "swoop" while you
  pull the free end.
- **Multiple named boards** you cycle through like tmux windows
  (`work`, `personal`, `ideas`, …). Each board has its own notes,
  strings, zoom, font, highlight color, and a unique cork grain.
- **Configurable background** — two independent axes from a live-preview
  popup (`b`): an ASCII-cork on/off toggle, and a fill color (transparent so
  the terminal/tmux theme shows through, a curated dark-theme palette, or a
  custom hex). Mix freely — cork over a dark color, or cork off for a clean
  solid. One global choice for the workspace.
- **Workspace zoom** — 5 levels (`-3..+1`) that scale note sizes *and*
  positions, so you can pack many stickies into an overview or lean in
  on a few.
- **3D zoom-to-edit** — a smooth scale + lift + shadow animation that
  settles into a card with a live textarea.
- **9 paper tints + 9 highlight colors + 8 text styles** (Unicode math
  alphabets: plain, bold, italic, bold-italic, script, fraktur,
  double-struck, monospace).
- **Undo everything** — a 50-step undo/redo stack covering every change:
  paste, edit, tint, move, string, note delete, even a deleted board. `u`
  undoes, `ctrl+r` redoes.
- Persists to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json` with debounced writes,
  keeping the last 20 distinct versions under `backups/`.

## Install

Requires **Go 1.23+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread.git
cd redthread
go build -o redthread ./cmd/redthread
./redthread
```

Or:

```bash
go install github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread/cmd/redthread@latest
redthread
```

First run with no save file gets a small demo board. `redthread --fresh`
ignores the save and reseeds.

## Demos

### Notes & feel

Click without moving for a small jiggle, drag for a drop bounce, `tab`
cycles with the same jiggle, `enter` zooms into a card with a smooth 3D
transition, `esc` lands back with a thud.

### Red strings

Pull strings between notes (or to bare cork as wall-pins) — the free end
swoops behind the cursor with weight. `[ ]` cycles the hovered string;
`t` toggles tight / slack; `f` toggles in-front-of / behind notes; `x`
cuts. Strings stay visibly attached when you drag a note.

### Boards

Top tab bar shows all boards; each has its own cork grain so they feel
distinct. `>` / `<` cycle, `B` creates and drops you straight into rename,
`R` renames, `D D` deletes (two-press confirm).

## Controls

### Mouse

| | |
|---|---|
| click a note | select + raise |
| drag | move (drops with a bounce) |

| `1` – `9` | tint the selected note (yellow, pink, blue, green, purple, orange, teal, cream, coral) |
| `c` | cycle the global highlight (border) color |
| `a` | open the font menu (live preview, enter to commit, esc to cancel) |
| `b` | open the background menu — toggle cork (`←`/`→`) and pick a fill color (transparent, a curated dark-theme palette, or custom hex); live preview, enter to commit, esc to cancel |
| `-` / `=` / `0` | zoom out / in / reset (5 levels) |
| `s` | start pulling a red string (arrows/`hjkl` nudge endpoint, `tab` snap to next note, `enter` commit, `esc` cancel) |

### Keyboard — boards

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `>` (or `.`) | next board |
| `<` (or `,`) | previous board |
| `{` / `}` | re-order: move the active board left / right (wraps) |
| `B` | new board (drops you into rename) |
| `R` | rename the active board |
| `D` | delete the active board (press twice within 2s; refuses if it's the last one) |

### Keyboard — edit

| key | action |
|---|---|
| typing | edit body (first non-empty line is the title; text renders in the board's font) |
| `ctrl+y` / `ctrl+p` | copy the note / paste at cursor (system clipboard) |
| drag mouse | native terminal selection — copy with your terminal's hotkey |
| `esc` | close + save with reverse transition |
| `ctrl+s` | save without closing |

## Data

Notes live at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json`, defaulting to
`~/.local/share/redthread/notes.json`. Writes are debounced (400 ms) so
rapid drags coalesce into one flush.

A legacy `brainfartadhdfixerupper/` directory auto-migrates on first
launch under the new name. v3 single-board files migrate forward into
the v4 workspace envelope.

### Undo and backups

`u` undoes and `ctrl+r` redoes, up to 50 steps. The stack covers *every*
change — pasting over a note, an edit, a tint, a move, a string, a deleted
note, a deleted board — not only deletions. A whole editing session
(`enter` … `esc`) undoes as one step, and a held arrow key coalesces into
one step rather than forty.

Because pasting replaces a note's entire contents, `ctrl+p` over a note
that already has text asks first: the footer reads `ctrl+p again to
replace <title>`, and only a second press within 3 seconds commits.

Undo lives in memory, so for anything that outlives the session there are
on-disk backups. Each save that actually changes something first copies
the previous `notes.json` to:

```
~/.local/share/redthread/backups/notes-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.mmm.json
```

The newest 20 are kept; saves that would write identical content don't
rotate, so idling doesn't flush real history out of the ring. To recover,
copy one back over `notes.json` while redthread is closed:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/redthread
ls backups/                       # newest last
cp backups/notes-20260814-160355.812.json notes.json
```

The workspace also stores a global `background` preference with two independent
fields: `cork` (the ASCII texture overlay, on/off) and `color` (a hex fill, or
omitted/`""` for transparent). For example `{"cork":false,"color":"#1a1b26"}` is
a solid Tokyo Night background with no cork. Files written before this option
load as cork-on + transparent, unchanged.

Schema (v5):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 5,
  "activeIdx": 0,
  "background": { "cork": true },
  "boards": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "grainSeed": 1777118907643042768,
      "zoom": 0,
      "textMode": 0,
      "highlightColor": 0,
      "notes":   [ { "id": "…", "title": "…", "body": "…",
                     "x": 3, "y": 1, "tint": "yellow",
                     "created": "…", "updated": "…" } ],
      "strings": [ { "a": { "note": "idA" }, "b": { "note": "idB" },
                     "tight": false, "front": false } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Customizing

Color palettes and text styles live in `internal/app/theme.go`:

- `Tints` + `TintOrder` — the 9 paper colors.
- `SelBorderChoices` — the 9 highlight colors.
- `TextModes` — the Unicode-alphabet font options.
- `StarChars` / `PoreChars` / `BlotchChars` — cork-texture char pools.

Edit any of those, rebuild, and the whole app picks up the new values
(help panel + menu + cycle included).

## File layout

## Changelog

**Latest**

*Features*
- Background is now configurable — press `b` for a picker with two independent axes:
  a **cork on/off toggle** (`←`/`→`) and a **fill color** — **transparent** (your
  terminal/tmux background shows through, the default), a curated **dark-theme palette**
  (github dark, tokyo night, catppuccin, dracula, nord, …), or a **custom hex**. Mix
  freely; the choice is global to the workspace and persists.
  ([#1](https://github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread/issues/1))

**Previous**

*Fixes*
- Fullwidth font removed — it never rendered correctly.
- `}` (move-active-board-right) was a no-op; it now actually shifts the active board.
- Opening a freshly created blank note no longer drops the cursor two rows below the title.

*Features*
- New notes start empty (only the initial seed has demo content).
- Open notes now render in the board's selected font.
- Strings are fully keyboard-drivable from `s` — arrows / `hjkl` nudge the free end, `tab` snaps to next note, `enter` commits, `esc` cancels.
- Boards re-orderable in the tab bar with `{` and `}`.
- Native terminal text selection inside open notes (mouse capture is released in edit mode).
- `ctrl+y` copies the selected note's text; `ctrl+p` pastes — into the cursor in edit mode, or onto the selected note in board mode.
- `u` undoes the most recent note delete (restores connected strings too).
- Subtle dim-crossfade + horizontal slide when switching boards.
