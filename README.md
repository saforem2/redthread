# redthread

A sticky-note pegboard for your terminal. Mouse-first, keyboard-friendly,
transparent over your tmux theme. ASCII-textured cork, dangling red
strings, smooth zoom, and multiple named boards you can switch between.

## What it is

- A small TUI meant to live in a tmux pane, always open.
- A cork pegboard rendered entirely in ASCII — your terminal background
  shows through, no solid fill.
- Sticky notes you drag with the mouse or nudge with the keyboard.
  Colored paper, red pin, ornate woven borders, paper-fiber flecks,
  drop shadow, fold glyph.
- **Red strings** between notes (or pinned to bare cork). Slack or
  tight. In-front-of or behind the notes. A weighted "swoop" while you
  pull the free end.
- **Multiple named boards** you cycle through like tmux windows
  (`work`, `personal`, `ideas`, …). Each board has its own notes,
  strings, zoom, font, highlight color, and a unique cork grain.
- **Configurable background** — two independent axes from a live-preview
  popup (`b`): an ASCII-cork on/off toggle, and a fill color (transparent so
  the terminal/tmux theme shows through, a curated palette of dark *and*
  light editor themes, or a custom hex). Mix freely — cork over a dark
  color, or cork off for a clean solid. One global choice for the workspace.
- **Light and dark palettes** — the board renders foreground-only, so its
  colors have to match your terminal background. redthread detects that
  background at startup and picks the matching palette; `T` flips it, and
  `--theme=light|dark` or `RT_THEME` forces it when detection can't see
  through tmux or ssh. See [Theme](#theme).
- **Workspace zoom** — 5 levels (`-3..+1`) that scale note sizes *and*
  positions, so you can pack many stickies into an overview or lean in
  on a few.
- **3D zoom-to-edit** — a smooth scale + lift + shadow animation that
  settles into a card with a live textarea.
- **Or edit in `$EDITOR`** — `e` hands the note to your real editor as a
  markdown file and reads it back when you quit. See [External editor](#external-editor).
- **Optional vim bindings** — `--vim` turns the note card modal: normal /
  insert / visual, the motions and operators you actually use. Off by
  default. See [Vim mode](#vim-mode).
- **9 paper tints + 9 highlight colors + 8 text styles** (Unicode math
  alphabets: plain, bold, italic, bold-italic, script, fraktur,
  double-struck, monospace).
- **Undo everything** — a 50-step undo/redo stack covering every change:
  paste, edit, tint, move, string, note delete, even a deleted board. `u`
  undoes, `ctrl+r` redoes.
- Persists to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json` with debounced writes,
  keeping the last 20 distinct versions under `backups/`.

## Install

Requires **Go 1.23+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread.git
cd redthread
go build -o redthread ./cmd/redthread
./redthread
```

Or:

```bash
go install github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread/cmd/redthread@latest
redthread
```

First run with no save file gets a small demo board. `redthread --fresh`
ignores the save and reseeds.

## Theme

The board sets only foreground colors and lets your terminal background
show through, so the palette has to know whether that background is dark
or light. On startup redthread asks the terminal for its background color
and picks the matching palette.

Plenty of setups swallow that query — tmux without `allow-passthrough`,
some ssh sessions, anything that isn't a TTY. When the answer doesn't come
back, redthread assumes dark. Override it:

```bash
redthread --theme=light     # force the light palette
redthread --theme=dark      # force the dark palette
redthread --theme=auto      # detect (the default)

export RT_THEME=light       # same, for your shell rc or tmux config
```

Precedence is `--theme` → `RT_THEME` → the saved choice → detection.

Inside the app, `T` toggles light/dark and remembers it, so the next launch
skips detection entirely. The choice is stored per workspace in
`notes.json`.

`--theme=auto` is an override like the other two, not the absence of one:
it re-detects *and* forgets a saved choice, so it's the way back to
detection after pressing `T`. (Deleting the `theme` key from `notes.json`
does the same thing.)

Both palettes carry the same nine tints and nine highlight colors under the
same names, so switching themes never disturbs a note's saved colors.

## Demos

### Notes & feel

Click without moving for a small jiggle, drag for a drop bounce, `tab`
cycles with the same jiggle, `enter` zooms into a card with a smooth 3D
transition, `esc` lands back with a thud.

![feel](docs/feel.gif)

### Red strings

Pull strings between notes (or to bare cork as wall-pins) — the free end
swoops behind the cursor with weight. `[ ]` cycles the hovered string;
`t` toggles tight / slack; `f` toggles in-front-of / behind notes; `x`
cuts. Strings stay visibly attached when you drag a note.

![strings](docs/strings.gif)

### Boards

Top tab bar shows all boards; each has its own cork grain so they feel
distinct. `>` / `<` cycle, `B` creates and drops you straight into rename,
`R` renames, `D D` deletes (two-press confirm).

## External editor

The built-in card is a textarea — fine for a few lines, less so for a long
note. `e` on a selected note (or `ctrl+e` from inside the card) writes it
to a temp `.md` file, suspends the TUI, and runs your editor:

```bash
export EDITOR=nvim        # or: hx, micro, "code -w", "emacsclient -nw"
```

`VISUAL` wins over `EDITOR` if both are set, by the usual convention. The
value is a command line, not just a program name, so flags work — `code
-w` and `subl -w` need their wait flags or the editor returns immediately.
With neither variable set, `e` says so instead of guessing at `vi`.

The file uses the same convention as the built-in editor: the first
non-empty line is the title, the rest is the body.

```markdown
write rfc

- auth spec
- sync protocol
```

The `.md` extension is deliberate — it's what makes your editor turn on
markdown highlighting.

Nothing is written back unless the file actually changed, so quitting
without saving is a no-op. The note is also left alone if the editor exits
non-zero (`:cq` in vim), if the file can't be read, or if it comes back
empty — a stray `:q!` on the wrong buffer shouldn't blank a note.
With `--vim`, the card is modal — see [Vim mode](#vim-mode).

## Vim mode

Off by default. Turn it on for a run, or for good:

```bash
redthread --vim           # this run (and remembered afterwards)
export RT_VIM=1           # for a shell rc or tmux config
```

The card then opens in normal mode, and the footer shows which mode you
are in. What's implemented:

| | |
|---|---|
| motions | `h j k l`, `w b e`, `0 $`, `gg G`, arrow keys |
| counts | `3l`, `2dd`, `5G`, and so on |
| insert | `i a I A o O`, `esc` back to normal |
| delete | `x`, `dd`, `D`, `dw`, `d$`, `d0` |
| change | `cw`, `cc`, `C` |
| yank/put | `yy`, `p`, `P`, and `dd` fills the same register (so `ddp` swaps lines) |
| visual | `v`, then a motion, then `d` / `c` / `y` |

`esc` in normal mode places the note back on the board, the same as `esc`
without vim enabled. `ctrl+s`, `ctrl+y`, `ctrl+p`, and `ctrl+e` keep their
meanings in every mode — they are app controls, not editing.

Anything not in that table is ignored rather than approximated. A key that
silently does something *close* to what vim would do is worse than one
that does nothing.

The behavior above was checked against real vim: `internal/app/vim_test.go`
contains a table of buffers and key sequences whose expected results were
produced by running them through `vim -Nu NONE -es`. That turned up five
bugs which hand-written tests had happily agreed with, including `dw` on a
line's last word deleting nothing and `cw` swallowing the following space.

## Data

Notes live at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/redthread/notes.json`, defaulting to
`~/.local/share/redthread/notes.json`. Writes are debounced (400 ms) so
rapid drags coalesce into one flush.

A legacy `brainfartadhdfixerupper/` directory auto-migrates on first
launch under the new name. v3 single-board files migrate forward into
the v4 workspace envelope.

### Undo and backups

`u` undoes and `ctrl+r` redoes, up to 50 steps. The stack covers *every*
change — pasting over a note, an edit, a tint, a move, a string, a deleted
note, a deleted board — not only deletions. A whole editing session
(`enter` … `esc`) undoes as one step, and a held arrow key coalesces into
one step rather than forty.

Because pasting replaces a note's entire contents, `ctrl+p` over a note
that already has text asks first: the footer reads `ctrl+p again to
replace <title>`, and only a second press within 3 seconds commits.

Undo lives in memory, so for anything that outlives the session there are
on-disk backups. Each save that actually changes something first copies
the previous `notes.json` to:

```
~/.local/share/redthread/backups/notes-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.nnnnnnnnn.json
```

The newest 20 are kept; saves that would write identical content don't
rotate, so idling doesn't flush real history out of the ring. To recover,
copy one back over `notes.json` while redthread is closed:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/redthread
ls backups/                       # newest last
cp backups/notes-20260814-160355.812734000.json notes.json
```

The workspace also stores a global `background` preference with two independent
fields: `cork` (the ASCII texture overlay, on/off) and `color` (a hex fill, or
omitted/`""` for transparent). For example `{"cork":false,"color":"#1a1b26"}` is
a solid Tokyo Night background with no cork. Files written before this option
load as cork-on + transparent, unchanged.

Schema (v6):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 6,
  "activeIdx": 0,
  "background": { "cork": true },
  "theme": "light",
  "boards": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "grainSeed": 1777118907643042768,
      "zoom": 0,
      "textMode": 0,
      "highlightColor": 0,
      "notes":   [ { "id": "…", "title": "…", "body": "…",
                     "x": 3, "y": 1, "tint": "yellow",
                     "created": "…", "updated": "…" } ],
      "strings": [ { "a": { "note": "idA" }, "b": { "note": "idB" },
                     "tight": false, "front": false } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`theme` is `"light"`, `"dark"`, or absent for auto-detect. v5 files simply
lack the key and load as auto, so nothing needs migrating.

## Customizing

Colors live in `internal/app/palette.go`, as two `Palette` values:

- `darkPalette()` / `lightPalette()` — the full color set for each
  terminal background, including `Tints` (the 9 paper colors),
  `SelBorderChoices` (the 9 highlight colors), the cork shades, the
  shadow, and the chrome.
- `ApplyTheme(light bool)` installs one of them into the package-level
  vars every draw site reads.

Text styles and character pools stay in `internal/app/theme.go`:

- `TextModes` — the Unicode-alphabet font options.
- `StarChars` / `PoreChars` / `BlotchChars` — cork-texture char pools.

Edit any of those, rebuild, and the whole app picks up the new values
(help panel + menu + cycle included).

When adding colors, note the rule the palettes follow: **text** needs
enough contrast to read (the light palette keeps ink under ~0.5 Rec-601
luma), but **texture** — cork specks, shadow dither — must instead sit the
*same distance* from the background as its dark counterpart sits from
black. Making texture merely "dark enough" turns the board into noise.
`theme_test.go` enforces both rules.

## File layout

## Changelog

**Latest**

*Features*
- Background is now configurable — press `b` for a picker with two independent axes:
  a **cork on/off toggle** (`←`/`→`) and a **fill color** — **transparent** (your
  terminal/tmux background shows through, the default), a curated **dark-theme palette**
  (github dark, tokyo night, catppuccin, dracula, nord, …), or a **custom hex**. Mix
  freely; the choice is global to the workspace and persists.
  ([#1](https://github.com/B33pBeeps/redthread/issues/1))

**Previous**

*Fixes*
- Fullwidth font removed — it never rendered correctly.
- `}` (move-active-board-right) was a no-op; it now actually shifts the active board.
- Opening a freshly created blank note no longer drops the cursor two rows below the title.

*Features*
- New notes start empty (only the initial seed has demo content).
- Open notes now render in the board's selected font.
- Strings are fully keyboard-drivable from `s` — arrows / `hjkl` nudge the free end, `tab` snaps to next note, `enter` commits, `esc` cancels.
- Boards re-orderable in the tab bar with `{` and `}`.
- Native terminal text selection inside open notes (mouse capture is released in edit mode).
- `ctrl+y` copies the selected note's text; `ctrl+p` pastes — into the cursor in edit mode, or onto the selected note in board mode.
- `u` undoes the most recent note delete (restores connected strings too).
- Subtle dim-crossfade + horizontal slide when switching boards.
